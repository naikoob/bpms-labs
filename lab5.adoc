= Lab 5 - Guided Rule Editor

== Goals
In this lab, we'll create more rules using the BPM Suite's Guided Rule Editor.

== 1. Maximum Value Rule

1. First, create a rule that rejects a policy quote when the value of the vehicle exceeds $500,000. In the BPM Suite Project Explorer, navigate to the `org.acme.insurance.eligibility` package.

* Do *not* check Use Domain Specific Language (DSL)

4. Like DRL from previous lab, first we import the objects we need in our rule. In the editor pane, click on `Data Objects` tab, and click `New Item`, and add `org.acme.insurance.Policy` and `org.acme.insurance.Vehicle`

12. Now we want to access the `marketValue` field of the `vehicle`. To do that, click on `This is a Vehicle` in the guided rule editor. In the resulting pop-up, click on `Show sub fields` and select `marketValue`.
+
The rule editor now look like this:

13. Click on the drop down next to marketValue and select `greater than`.

14. Click on the pencil icon next to `greater than` and select `Literal Value`. A small text box now appears in place of the icon. Enter the value `5000000` in the text box.

+

16. Select the `addRejection` method, and `Literal value` for string parameter. Enter a rejection reason, such as `Vehicle value exceeds maximum allowed for online quote`. The completed rule should look like this:
